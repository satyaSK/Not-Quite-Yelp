# Not-Quite-Yelp
RESTful Yelp API clone to serve http requests for businesses, reviews & photos with pagination. Built endpoints to support JWT-based authorization, image uploads and image storage using GridFS. Implemented IP-based rate limiting using Redis cache and facilitated offline image resizing using RabbitMQ.
